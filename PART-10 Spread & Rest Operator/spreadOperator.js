// Spread Operator
// ----------------
// The spread operator(...) is a new addition to the set of operators in Javascript ES6. 
// It takes in an iterable (e.g array, string, object) and expands it into individual elements. 
// The spread operator is commonly used to make shallow copies of JS Objects. 
// Using this operator makes the code consise and anhances its readability
